<h1>Part 2 – History & Civilization of Greece</h1>

<h2>🗿 Prehistoric & Bronze Age (7000–1100 BCE)</h2>
<p>Greece's history starts about 7000 years ago with the beginning of farming communities. People lived in villages and grew crops brought from nearby Anatolia. During the Bronze Age, advanced civilizations like the Minoans on Crete and the Mycenaeans on the mainland built palaces and developed strong trade networks. They also invented early writing systems to help with administration.</p>
