🎙️ HISTORY AND CIVILIZATION OF GREECE – NEWS REPORT SCRIPT

From the rise of small farming villages to the creation of democracy, the story of Greece is one of growth, discovery, and lasting influence.
Let’s take a trip through time and see how Greece became one of the most important civilizations in the world.

🗿 Prehistoric & Bronze Age (7000–1100 BCE)
It all started around 7000 BCE, when people in Greece began farming and forming small villages.
Over time, advanced civilizations such as the Minoans on the island of Crete and the Mycenaeans on the Greek mainland rose to power.
They built magnificent palaces, traded across the Mediterranean, and created one of the earliest writing systems known as Linear B.
This period laid the foundation for Greek culture, art, and trade.

🌑 Dark Ages (1100–800 BCE)
Around 1100 BCE, the great Bronze Age civilizations suddenly collapsed.
Many cities were destroyed, and people returned to living in small farming communities.
Writing disappeared, and Greece entered a period of isolation and simplicity.
During this time, iron tools began to replace bronze ones, which changed farming and warfare.
Though the era was dark, it prepared the way for a new beginning.

🏛️ Archaic Period (800–500 BCE)
As Greece recovered, powerful city-states called poleis began to form.
Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and others became independent centers of culture, politics, and trade.
Greeks explored and built colonies around the Mediterranean, spreading their influence far and wide.
The Greek alphabet was developed, and the first Olympic Games were held, bringing people together through sport and shared traditions.

🌟 Classical Period (500–323 BCE)
The Classical Period is known as the Golden Age of Greece.
Athens became the birthplace of democracy, where free men could vote and take part in decisions.
The Greeks united to defeat the powerful Persian Empire, boosting confidence and pride.
This was also the age of great thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and incredible achievements in art, theatre, and architecture.
However, rivalry between Athens and Sparta led to the long Peloponnesian War, which weakened both sides.

⚔️ Hellenistic Period (323–31 BCE)
After the death of his father, Alexander the Great became king and built a massive empire stretching from Greece to India.
He spread Greek culture, language, and ideas throughout Asia and Africa.
Even after his death, his empire broke into smaller kingdoms, but Greek influence continued to shape art, science, and education across many lands.

🏺 Roman & Byzantine Periods (31 BCE–1453 CE)
Eventually, Greece became part of the Roman Empire, but its culture remained powerful.
Greek art, philosophy, and education deeply influenced the Romans.
When the Roman Empire split, the eastern part became the Byzantine Empire, which preserved Greek language and Orthodox Christianity for more than a thousand years.
The capital city, Constantinople, became one of the greatest centers of culture and learning in the world.

🕌 Ottoman Rule (1453–1821)
In 1453, the Byzantine Empire fell to the Ottomans, and Greece came under their rule for almost four hundred years.
Even though they were ruled by foreigners, the Greek people kept their culture, language, and religion alive.
Gradually, the spirit of freedom began to rise again among the people, preparing them for revolution.

⚖️ Modern Greece (1821–Today)
In 1821, the Greeks began their War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire.
With help from countries like Britain, France, and Russia, Greece won its freedom and became an independent nation.
Today, Greece continues to balance its rich ancient traditions with modern life.
It is a proud member of the European Union and remains one of the most culturally influential nations in the world.
